          <p>Autograder is a new tool for students and teaching staff for submitting and validating lab assignments and is developed at the University of Stavanger. All lab submissions from students are handled using Git, a source code management system, and GitHub, a web-based hosting service for Git source repositories.</p>

          <p>Students push their updated lab submissions to GitHub. Every lab submission is then processed by a custom continuous integration tool. This tool will run several test cases on the submitted code. Autograder generates feedback that let the students verify if their submission implements the required functionality. This feedback is available through a web interface. The feedback from the Autograder system can be used by students to improve their submissions.</p>

          <p>Below is a step-by-step explanation of how to register and sign up for the lab project in Autograder.</p>
