### Deprecation Notice ###

The git package are in the process of being replaced with 
a new package called entities. The deprecation is due to a
upgrade to new storage solution, boltdb. Using boltdb will 
make the storage solution easier to manage and more 
durable while using. 

A migration tool will help the transition over to the new
solution, and the old implementation will be kept until 
all the necassery transitions are complete.
